### Hey, I am Aparna
I am an MS CS student at Georgia Tech. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering from College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University in June 2022. I am proficient in programming with C, C++, Java, Python and full stack development. 
I currently work in the Distributed Data Intensive Systems Lab at Georgia Tech.

I enjoy solving problems- strategizing and thinking of all possible edge cases. I have developed a strong penchant for Machine Learning particularly Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I am currently exploring Reinforcement Learning, Multimodal analysis and Generative modelling.
